# Interactive ML Model Trainer

This is a Streamlit-based application that allows you to interactively train and evaluate machine learning models. The app lets you:

- **Select a Dataset:** Choose a predefined Seaborn dataset (like iris, tips, or titanic) or upload your own CSV file.
- **Preview Your Data:** View a snapshot of your dataset.
- **Configure Your Model:** Pick a target variable and features, then select between regression and classification tasks. You can choose from models like Linear/Logistic Regression or Random Forest, and adjust parameters such as test size, number of trees, and more.
- **Train and Evaluate:** Train the model with your settings, view performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, MSE, RÂ²), and see visualizations like residual distributions, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance charts.
- **Download the Model:** Export the trained model for later use.

This app makes it easy to explore machine learning concepts with an interactive, user-friendly interface.
